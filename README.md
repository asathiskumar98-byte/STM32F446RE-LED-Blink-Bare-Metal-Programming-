# 💡 STM32F446RE – LED Blink (Bare Metal Programming)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to **blink an onboard LED** using the **STM32F446RE** microcontroller through **bare-metal programming** in **Keil µVision**.  
It directly accesses **RCC** (clock) and **GPIO** registers using the CMSIS header file `stm32f446xx.h` — no HAL or CubeMX used.

## ⚙️ Hardware Details

**Microcontroller:** STM32F446RE  
**IDE:** Keil µVision  
**Programming Method:** Bare Metal (Register-level)  
**LED Pin:** PA5 (Onboard LED – Nucleo Board)

## 🔩 Code Explanation

### 1️⃣ Enable HSI Clock
```c
RCC->CR |= (1<<0);   // Enable internal high-speed oscillator (HSI)
```
### 2️⃣ Enable GPIOA Clock
```c
RCC->AHB1ENR |= (1<<0);   // Enable clock for GPIOA
```
### 3️⃣ Configure GPIOA Pin 5 as Output
```c
GPIOA->MODER |= (1<<10);   // Set PA5 as General Purpose Output
GPIOA->OTYPER = 0x0000;    // Push-pull output type
GPIOA->OSPEEDR = 0x00000000; // Low speed
```
### 4️⃣ Toggle LED with Software Delay
```c
while(1)
{
	GPIOA->ODR |= (1<<5);   // LED ON
	delay(500000); delay(500000);

	GPIOA->ODR &= ~(1<<5);  // LED OFF
	delay(500000); delay(500000);
}
```
### 🕹️ Output Behavior

The onboard LED (PA5) will blink continuously with a fixed delay.
Each delay cycle is generated by a simple software loop, which isn’t timing accurate but sufficient for demonstration.

### 🧠 Key Learning Points

Understanding RCC (Reset and Clock Control) registers

Configuring GPIO pins directly using MODER, OTYPER, OSPEEDR, and ODR registers

Implementing software delays without using timers

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

Replace software delay with Timer-based delay (using TIM2 or SysTick)

Add push-button input for manual LED control

Extend to multiple GPIO pins for pattern-based LED blinking
